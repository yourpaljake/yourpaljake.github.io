Abstract- <br>
Very Good!<br>
<br>
Introduction and Theory-<br>
The context in this section is very good. Consider reformatting how equations are displayed. I find it to be a bit difficult to follow. Having arrows and numerous equals signs (more than 2) can be extraneous and consider omitting trivial algebraic steps. Consider cleaning up how constants are displayed in the first paragraph of page 3 (also consider adding page numbers).<br>
<br>
Methods-<br>
There are some parts scattered throughout this section where the language could be a bit more formal, but otherwise this section is good. I liked the inclusion of the diffraction rings for reference.<br>
<br>
Discussion-<br>
Again in this section, there are parts where the language could be more formal (ex: “Of course, 3.124% error is not perfect”). Good discussion of error sources.<br>
<br>
Conclusion-<br>
Good<br>
<br>
————————————<br>
Overall, very good paper. I did not like the “data dump” in the appendices, and if you would like to still include this, I would suggest cleaning it up as it looks busy and cluttered.<br>
