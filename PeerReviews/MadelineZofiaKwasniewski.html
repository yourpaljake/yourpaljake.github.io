Section by Section Review: <br>
Abstract-<br>
You could add more information/context to this section. It seems too brief.<br>
<br>
Introduction-<br>
First sentence, why is physics capitalized? “In their quest to make a better TV”- expand TV and/or give more context. Otherwise, good context.<br>
<br>
Theory-<br>
Please clarify paragraph 1. All of the “1.A”s and the “1.E”s are confusion. Good formatting of equations and derivations. Right after equation 4 “lambda is in nanometer” make that plural. (Eq. 5) What are the units of theta? What are the units of d? Fix nth order and 1st order right after equation 8. Why is wavelength capitalized after equation 9? Fix the formatting for Table 1.1 (have label on same page as table)<br>
<br>
Experimental Apparatus and Procedures-<br>
Space out the dimensions for the Specifications section. Otherwise good.<br>
<br>
Data analysis, results, and uncertainties- <br>
Capitalize this and remove the period. Include a picture of the actual electron diffraction rings for reference.<br>
<br>
Discussion- <br>
Good<br>
<br>
Conclusion- <br>
Expand more and act more as a conclusion to summarize the paper.<br>
<br>
References<br>
Add references for the referenced experiments in the Introduction section<br>
<br>
———————————<br>
Overall, very good. There are a couple small things, but this is overall very well written. Consider adding the suggestions especially for the Data analysis sections onwards.
