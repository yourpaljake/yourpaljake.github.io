# Personal Website

Welcome to the GitHub repository for my personal website. This site is a labor of love, developed entirely from scratch. It serves as a digital portfolio showcasing my journey as a developer, my projects, and my passions.

## Highlights
- **Custom Built**: Every line of code was written with a purpose, reflecting my personal journey in software development.
- **Learning and Sharing**: Includes sections dedicated to educational content, from math tutorials to coding walkthroughs.

Thank you for visiting, and I hope you enjoy exploring my site as much as I enjoyed creating it.
